<p align="justify">This objective of this project is to apply text analytics methods to the field of stock market trading, 
concentrating on Tesla, Inc. Our goal is to forecast changes in stock prices by using sentiment 
analysis on news stories and social media data, especially tweets on Tesla. This procedure 
entails looking through historic data on Tesla stock prices, preparing the information, using 
text analytics techniques, creating prediction models, and assessing how well they work. Based 
on the model's predictions, the analysis will place a strong emphasis on evaluating prospective 
gains and the variability of profitability. With the help of this assignment, we hope to learn 
more about how sentiment affects Tesla's stock price and assess how useful text analytics are 
for making wise trading decisions.</p>
